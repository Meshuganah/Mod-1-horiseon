On the job challenge for Horiseon seo webpage.
HTML semantics were added to page to increase accessibility and readability. Alt tags were also added to all of the images for the same purpose.

CSS files were reorganized to better match the HTML layout of the page.

Class tags were edited in HTML and then renamed in the CSS file to group like CSS elements and reduce the amount of repetitive code in the CSS file.

Comments were added to both files to more easily identify the sections and separate them from each other.
